In order to use Ore Infinium, you must compile it (I don't have time to make
binaries each day). Before you can do that, you must install the following:

* SDL 2.x http://www.libsdl.org/hg.php
* SDL_mixer 2.x http://hg.libsdl.org/
* PugiXML http://pugixml.org/
* FreeType (also for fonts)
* FTGL (for font rendering) 'svn co https://ftgl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ftgl'
